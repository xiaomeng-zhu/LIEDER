# Instructions
In each trial of this experiment, you will be given two sentences. You will have 5 seconds to read the sentences. After you are done reading, move the grey dot on the slider that appears below the sentences to indicate whether you think **the second (2nd) sentence** is an **acceptable continuation** of **the first sentence (1st)**. 

For example, if you think that the second sentence is a fully acceptable continuation of the first one, move the grey dot all the way to the right. Otherwise, if you think that the second sentence cannot follow from the first sentence, move the slider all the way to the left.

You will go through two practice trials to get familiar with the task.
