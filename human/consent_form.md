**Purpose of study**

In this research, Robert Frank, of Yale University, is investigating the processes involved in the comprehension of English sentences. The information collected in this study will be used in the preparation of papers for presentation in international conferences and journals on language. You are eligible to participate in this study because you are a native English speaker and an adult according to the laws of your local jurisdiction.

**Procedures**
In each trial of this study, you will be given two sentences. After you read the two sentences, you will be asked to indicate your judgment on a slider scale about whether you think the second sentence is an acceptable continuation of the first one. There are two practice trials for you to get familiar with the task. The entire process should take around 15 minutes. You will be compensated based on the average estimated study completion time, at a rate of 14 USD per hour.

**Risks**
There are no known risks involved in this experimental procedure. However, with any online research there is a minimal risk of breach of confidentiality. To guard against this possibility, we will not collect any uniquely identifying information on the servers where our data is collected.

**Benefits**
You will receive no immediate personal benefits from your participation in this research other than your compensation.

**Confidentiality**
Your results will be kept confidential to the best of our ability. Your name will not appear in any publication or presentation. To maximize confidentiality, your results will be assigned to a subject identifier even for our own analyses, and information linking you to your data will be kept confidential or discarded.

**Source of funding**
This study is funded by the Linguistics Department at Yale University.
